The main todo is to create a validation layer between the code that reads and
stores the input and the part of the code that outputs the data.  Ideally, the
validation layer will remove all of the assumptions about whether the input was
correct and tag all errors before the emit functions ever start.

The validation layer should catch all errors that will result in an error when
the output is compiled.

Examples of things that the validation layer should do:
1.  Verify that there are no name collisions between states and transition
    names. This is not a bad error of its self, but it probably indicates an
    error in the definition.

2.  Verify that all of the state names that are defined with the states keyword
    are actually represented by a state definition.

3.  Verify that all of the state definitions are actually declaired in the
    states definition.  This is an error that is caught by the compiler.

There are lots more things that this layer should do.
